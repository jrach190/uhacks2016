# OpenSeeDoors
Project Created by Jonathan Rach, John Martincic, Evan Williams, and Karthik Vijay for the UHacks 2016 Hackathon at the University of Miami on February 20th-21st.

# Version
0.1.0

# Description
OpenSeeDoors is a better alternative for those with accessibility needs to access secure areas using facial recognition. Using a webcam this program will take multiple photos of a person, then use the [OpenCV Library](http://opencv.org/) to compare a face to a known library. If it finds a match it will open a door.

# Planned Functionality
We originally planned to integrate the [Octoblu API](https://developer.octoblu.com/) into this project to send text messages to caretakers/admins, but due to an issue with registering the [Intel Edison](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison) board we were using, we were unable to use true IoT functionality on the board and as a result couln't register the Octoblu API.
